# Project: Café Sales Forecast Model ☕

## Status: ✅ Complete

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated:
- Regression Analysis
- Forecasting with Excel
- Business Intelligence
- Data Visualization

### 📌 Project Summary:
This project explores how external variables (temperature) affect iced coffee sales in a café setting. Using synthetic data and simple linear regression in Excel, we model the relationship:

Daily Iced Coffee Sales = α + β * Temperature + ε


The result? A clear forecast that helps the business:
- Predict sales volume based on weather
- Optimize inventory and staffing
- Run data-backed promotions

### 📂 Files Included:
- `cafe_sales_data.xlsx`: Synthetic dataset for 90 days
- `sales_forecast_model.xlsx`: Regression model + forecast sheet
- `summary_charts.png`: Visuals for LinkedIn/post

### ✅ Business Use Case:
Instead of guessing how many cups to prep, this model gives the café owner **actionable data**:
> “Every 1°C rise = ~40 more iced coffees/day.”

That’s the power of simple analytics.
